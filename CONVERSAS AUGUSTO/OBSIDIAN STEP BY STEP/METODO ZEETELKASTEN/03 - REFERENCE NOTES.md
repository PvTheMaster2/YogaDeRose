The sources describe Fleeting Notes as the initial, temporary stage in capturing thoughts within an Obsidian Zettelkasten system1 .... These are quick and raw annotations, captured spontaneously as ideas arise1 . Their primary function is to not lose these immediate insights1 .... They act as a starting point for generating more elaborate notes later1 ....

Here's a breakdown of what the sources say about Fleeting Notes in relation to other note types:

•

Characteristics:

◦

They are unstructured and do not follow a fixed template1 .... They are essentially rough drafts without much initial organization1 .

◦

Fleeting Notes are temporary by nature1 .... They are meant to be reviewed and either incorporated into the Zettelkasten or discarded later10 .

◦

They are often brief and not very detailed11 .

◦

A minimal or non-existent template is typical for Fleeting Notes11 .

◦

The best tool for capturing them is often whatever is readily available, like a pencil and paper12 .

•

Purpose:

◦

Their main purpose is to capture spontaneous insights and ideas quickly without interrupting workflow1 .... This ensures that important thoughts are not forgotten13 .

◦

They serve as a placeholder for ideas or information that may not be relevant in the long term but need to be recorded quickly10 .

•

Connection to other note types:

◦

Fleeting Notes serve as the initiation point for the knowledge creation flow14 ....

◦

They can be "refined" into two main paths: Literature Notes or Permanent Notes4 .... The raw ideas are processed and developed into more structured forms16 ....

◦

In a well-defined Zettelkasten flow, Fleeting Notes give rise to Literature or Permanent Notes18 .

•

Lifecycle:

◦

Being temporary, Fleeting Notes should be subsequently processed1 ....

◦

Often, they are erased or discarded after being processed11 .

In the larger context of Note Types within a Zettelkasten system in Obsidian:

•

The system typically involves a progression: Fleeting Notes capture initial thoughts15 ....

•

These are then developed into Literature Notes, which focus on extracting information from external sources1 .... Literature Notes always require a link back to their source1 ....

•

Permanent Notes form the core of the Zettelkasten, where knowledge is consolidated and expressed in one's own words, often stemming from processing Fleeting and Literature Notes1 .... A key principle for Permanent Notes is that they should be understandable even without reading the original source1 ....

•

Project Notes are temporary notes used to organize tasks and information for specific projects, often drawing upon the knowledge contained in Permanent Notes1 ....

•

Structure Notes (or Maps of Content) serve as high-level organizational hubs, linking together related notes and providing an overview of topics1 ....

The flow emphasizes transforming raw, initial thoughts captured in Fleeting Notes into more refined and interconnected knowledge within the system15 .... The ephemeral nature of Fleeting Notes highlights their role as a transient first step in a more deliberate knowledge development process11 ....

Discuss what these sources say about Literature Notes, in the larger context of Note Types.

Based on the sources, Literature Notes are a crucial note type within the Zettelkasten system adapted for Obsidian, serving as an intermediary step between initial fleeting ideas and the development of permanent knowledge1 .... Their primary function is to capture information from specific external sources such as books, articles, videos, and podcasts1 ....

Here's a more detailed breakdown of Literature Notes in the context of note types:

•

Definition and Purpose: Literature Notes record information extracted from sources, helping you extract the important points, summarize arguments, highlight relevant passages, and add your own initial observations1 .... They serve to integrate external knowledge into your personal thinking and work19 .

•

Origin: Literature Notes can originate in two ways: either by being refined from raw and spontaneous Fleeting Notes that capture initial insights1 ..., or by being created directly from the sources themselves as you read or engage with the material3 . This aligns with the SIP model (Sources → Ideas → Projects), where external sources are processed into ideas5 ....

•

Key Requirement: Source Reference: A fundamental rule emphasized across the sources is that every Literature Note must contain a clear reference to its original source1 .... This is crucial for maintaining traceability and the integrity of your knowledge1 .... The reference can be a link, book title, DOI, or page number1 ....

•

Content: Literature Notes typically include citations and the context of the source6 .... They capture ideas from the authors in your own words but with enough context to be understood later1 . Examples of types of Literature Notes include notes on books, quotes, people, recipes, terms, and tools3 ....

•

Relationship with Fleeting Notes: Fleeting Notes are brief, unstructured jottings of immediate thoughts1 .... They are temporary and serve as a starting point, often being refined into more detailed Literature Notes (or directly into Permanent Notes)1 ....

•

Relationship with Permanent Notes: Literature Notes play a vital role in the creation of Permanent Notes, which are the heart of the Zettelkasten1 .... Literature Notes feed Permanent Notes with reference material2 .... The process involves taking the information from Literature Notes and synthesizing it in your own words to form atomic, independent, and permanent notes that consolidate your understanding1 .... A Reference Note (a type of Literature Note) can serve as the base for a Permanent Note16 .... AI can be used to generate Permanent Notes from Literature Notes15 ....

•

Relationship with Project Notes: While Literature Notes don't directly lead to Project Notes, the Permanent Notes derived from them can be utilized in Project Notes to produce concrete outputs2 ....

•

Relationship with Structure Notes: Literature Notes contain the information and ideas that Structure Notes (or Maps of Content) help to organize and connect1 .... Structure Notes act as navigation hubs for collections of Permanent Notes, which in turn originated from Literature Notes1 ....

In essence, Literature Notes are a critical stage in the Zettelkasten workflow within Obsidian, ensuring that external knowledge is carefully captured, properly attributed, and serves as a foundation for developing your own understanding and building a connected network of permanent knowledge28 ....

Here's a breakdown of what the sources say about Permanent Notes in the context of other note types:

Origin and Flow:

•

Permanent Notes typically arise from Fleeting Notes and/or Literature Notes1 .... Fleeting Notes capture raw, spontaneous insights1 ..., while Literature Notes record information extracted from specific sources1 .... These preliminary notes serve as the raw material that is then refined and synthesized into Permanent Notes1 ....

•

Literature Notes feed into Permanent Notes by providing the reference material and context4 .... You extract key points from sources in Literature Notes and then process those insights into your own understanding within Permanent Notes1 ....

•

Permanent Notes form the foundation for Project Notes4 .... The consolidated knowledge in Permanent Notes can be applied to specific, goal-oriented projects1 ....

•

Structure Notes organize and connect Permanent Notes1 .... They act as navigational hubs, linking to collections of Permanent Notes on a particular topic1 ....

Key Characteristics and Purpose:

•

Atomic and Singular Idea: Each Permanent Note should focus on one central idea to maintain clarity and facilitate connections1 .... Avoid mixing multiple concepts in a single note1 .

•

Written in Your Own Words: Permanent Notes should express your understanding and interpretation of the information, not just a copy of the source material1 .... This demonstrates consolidated knowledge1 ....

•

Independent and Understandable: A Permanent Note should have its own context and be understandable even without referring to the original source1 .... While the source should always be referenced, the core idea should stand alone1 ....

•

Long-Lasting and Reusable: These notes form the basis of your durable knowledge and can be reused and connected with other ideas to generate new insights1 .... They are not meant to be temporary26 .

•

Building Blocks of Knowledge: Permanent Notes are the building blocks of your knowledge network16 .... Their interconnectedness leads to the emergence of knowledge and new insights27 .

Metadata and Linking:

•

Permanent Notes should have descriptive and unique titles1 .

•

Metadata in the YAML frontmatter is crucial for Permanent Notes. This can include:

◦

tags: To classify the note by type (#type/note), theme (#theme/psychology), or status (#status/idea)8 .... The #type/note tag can be considered mandatory to indicate its role in the system30 ....

◦

aliases: Alternative titles for easier searching8 ....

◦

created and modified dates for tracking note evolution8 ....

◦

lead: A brief summary or key phrase defining the note8 ....

Discuss what these sources say about Project Notes, in the larger context of Note Types.

The sources describe Project Notes as a specific type of note within a Zettelkasten system adapted for Obsidian, serving a distinct function within the overall workflow of knowledge management1 ....

Definition and Purpose:

•

Project Notes are notes geared towards specific projects, having a temporary scope and a defined objective1 . They are dedicated to specific, time-bound projects3 ....

•

Their primary function is to organize tasks, research, and content related to a particular final goal or deliverable1 .... They help you stay organized and on track while working on a specific project by keeping all relevant information in one place7 .

•

Project Notes are designed to ensure that transitory and actionable information of a project (like drafts of an article, task lists, or video planning) do not mix with permanent knowledge1 .

Characteristics:

•

Project Notes can be temporary or permanent8 .

•

They are linked to real tasks8 .

•

A good practice is to group each project in a dedicated folder – "one folder per project"1 .

•

These notes should include links to sources (similar to Literature Notes)1 .

•

They can also contain a link to the target or result of the project, such as a published article or final presentation1 .

Relationship to Other Note Types:

•

Permanent Notes are the foundation for Project Notes9 . Project Notes are based on Permanent Notes, applying the acquired knowledge to concrete projects9 . Permanent Notes form the base of your lasting knowledge, which can then be utilized to produce something concrete in Project Notes10 .

•

While Fleeting Notes and Literature Notes serve as building blocks for Permanent Notes, they indirectly contribute to Project Notes by enriching the permanent knowledge base that Project Notes draw upon10 ....

•

Structure Notes help to organize and navigate through your entire knowledge base, including Permanent Notes that might be relevant to a current project. Project Notes themselves might even be linked to from Structure Notes if they represent a significant ongoing endeavor13 ....

•

In the SIP model (Sources → Ideas → Projects), Project Notes represent the final stage where refined ideas (in the form of Permanent Notes) are applied to create tangible outcomes15 ....

Examples of Content:

•

Examples of what Project Notes might contain include organizing tasks, research materials, drafts of an article, lists of tasks for a job, or planning for a video1 ....

•

They might also include links to relevant Permanent Notes and, ultimately, a link to the finished product1 .

Metadata and Organization:

•

Project Notes can optionally use the #status/... tag to track the state of the project (e.g., #status/ongoing, #status/complete)1 ....

•

The #target/... tag can also be used to indicate the intended outcome or application of the project (e.g., #target/ebook, #target/blog, #target/presentation)1 ....

•

Maintaining Project Notes separately from permanent knowledge ensures that project-specific information doesn't clutter the long-term knowledge base1 ....

In summary, Project Notes in an Obsidian Zettelkasten act as temporary workspaces focused on specific goals, drawing upon the consolidated knowledge within Permanent Notes and keeping project-related information distinct from the evergreen content of the system. They are a crucial step in applying the knowledge developed within the Zettelkasten to produce tangible results9 ....

Discuss what these sources say about Structure Notes, in the larger context of Note Types.

The sources consistently describe Structure Notes, also frequently referred to as Maps of Content (MOC) or index notes, as a crucial note type within an Obsidian Zettelkasten system that serves to organize and connect other notes1 .... They act as high-level entry points and navigation hubs for related ideas, providing an overview of a topic or area of knowledge1 ....

Here's a breakdown of what the sources say about Structure Notes in the larger context of Note Types:

•

Purpose:

◦

Their primary function is to organize and structure other notes within the system1 .... They help create relationships between different notes and establish the overall structure of the Zettelkasten8 .

◦

They serve as hubs of navigation through your knowledge1 .... By linking to collections of permanent notes on a particular topic, they provide visões gerais of a subject1 .

◦

Structure Notes can help to give context to the other notes in the system9 .

◦

They facilitate finding and accessing specific notes quickly, acting like an index or table of contents for the Zettelkasten10 .

•

Characteristics:

◦

Generally, they do not contain much new information themselves1 ... but rather point to collections of other notes1 ....

◦

They are notes about notes11 , mapping the structures within your knowledge11 .

◦

They are considered "notes de controle" that aggregate or organize other notes by theme, purpose, or time12 .

•

Examples and Types:

◦

The sources provide several examples of what can function as Structure Notes:

▪

Maps of Content (MOC)1 ...

▪

Index Notes1 ... (e.g., sorted lists, glossaries, bibliographies10 )

▪

Summary Notes9 (e.g., meeting notes, collections from a bullet journal9 )

▪

Bullet Journals1 ... (as structural notes of calendar events1 )

▪

Frameworks13 ...

▪

Glossaries1 ...

▪

Bibliographies14 ...

▪

Concept Maps10 ...

▪

Ontology Maps14

▪

Lists13

▪

Indexes13 ...

▪

OKR (Objectives and Key Results)12

▪

Meeting notes12

•

Connection to other Note Types:

◦

Structure Notes are closely linked to Permanent Notes17 .... They organize collections of Permanent Notes by topic1 .

◦

They help navigate and organize all other note types6 ....

◦

They can be used to organize Literature Notes1 . For example, a Structure Note could be a "📚 Leituras Importantes" that organizes links to various Literature Notes1 .

◦

Structure Notes, along with Dataview, serve to organize and navigate all the other notes in a Zettelkasten20 .

◦

The flow described in the sources indicates that Permanent Notes are often the notes being organized by Structure Notes22 ....

•

Metadata and Organization:

◦

A mandatory tag for Structure Notes is suggested as #type/structure and they can be accessed via #structure/ followed by a more specific identifier (e.g., #structure/list)13 .

◦

They generally do not contain a mandatory link to a source unless they are aggregating ideas from multiple sources14 .

◦

Dataview can be used to create dynamic Structure Notes based on metadata and links, automatically listing and organizing notes1 ....

In the larger context of Note Types, Structure Notes play a vital role in making the Zettelkasten a navigable and interconnected system. While Fleeting Notes are for quick capture, Literature Notes for external information, and Permanent Notes for core knowledge, Structure Notes provide the overarching architecture that allows you to find connections and understand the landscape of your thinking23 .... They are essential for preventing a Zettelkasten from becoming a disorganized collection of notes and instead transforming it into a dynamic and evolving network of knowledge30 . Project Notes, on the other hand, are focused on specific goals and often draw upon the organized knowledge within the Permanent and Structure Notes1 .... The SIP Model (Sources → Ideas → Projects) also indirectly highlights the role of Structure Notes in organizing the "Ideas" (Permanent Notes) that then feed into "Projects"31 ....

Discuss what these sources say about Reference Note, in the larger context of Note Types.

The sources discuss Reference Notes, primarily within the "Explicação imagens.md" source, positioning them within the broader context of note types in an Obsidian Zettelkasten system1 ....

According to "Explicação imagens.md", Reference Notes serve the function of registering content retrieved from specific sources such as books, articles, and dictionaries1 ....

Here's how the sources describe Reference Notes in relation to other note types:

•

Relationship with Literature Notes: The description of Reference Notes strongly overlaps with that of Literature Notes as described in "CHAT_GPT_INVESTIGAR_1.md" and "Explicação imagens.md"2 .... Both are concerned with capturing information from external sources. "Explicação imagens.md" even lists types of Reference Notes such as #type/term, #type/book, #type/person, #type/quote, and #type/tool, which are all examples of information one would extract from external sources, aligning with the purpose of Literature Notes2 . "make_useful_notes_v0-18-0_2023-07-24_sem_paginas_2em1.pdf" also mentions Literature Notes as capturing information from external sources like books and articles6 . The "Explicação imagens.md" source explicitly states that Literature Notes can come directly from "Sources"4 . Therefore, it appears that Reference Notes and Literature Notes are very similar, if not synonymous, in their function of capturing and storing information from external sources.

•

Connection to Permanent Notes: "Explicação imagens.md" states that a Reference Note can be a base for a Permanent Note2 . This aligns with the general Zettelkasten workflow described in multiple sources, where information extracted in Literature/Reference Notes is then processed, synthesized, and expressed in one's own words to create Permanent Notes3 ....

•

Tagging: Reference Notes in "Explicação imagens.md" have a mandatory tag #type/ followed by a specific type like #type/term or #type/book2 . They also utilize the #source/ tag to indicate the origin of the information and #theme/ tags, similar to Permanent Notes, to categorize the content by topic2 . This emphasis on tagging is consistent with the broader discussion of tags as a crucial organizational layer in a Zettelkasten within Obsidian, allowing for classification and filtering of notes10 ....

•

Source Linking: Like Literature Notes, the concept of a Reference Note inherently implies a connection back to the original source. While "Explicação imagens.md" emphasizes that every note needs a link to its source as a simple rule7 ..., it specifically mentions the #source/ tag for Reference Notes2 . This reinforces the fundamental Zettelkasten principle of maintaining traceability and the integrity of knowledge by always noting the origin of information16 ....

In the larger context of Note Types, Reference Notes (or Literature Notes) occupy a crucial intermediate step in the Zettelkasten workflow. They bridge the gap between encountering external information (Sources) and integrating that information into one's own knowledge base as Permanent Notes. They differ from Fleeting Notes in that they are focused on specific sources and aim for more structured recording of information, often following a template that includes source details3 .... They are distinct from Project Notes, which are focused on specific tasks and goals, and from Structure Notes, which serve to organize and connect existing knowledge3 ....

Therefore, Reference Notes are a vital component of the Zettelkasten system within Obsidian, acting as the primary mechanism for capturing and processing information from external sources, with a strong emphasis on linking back to those sources and serving as a foundation for the development of personal understanding within Permanent Notes.
